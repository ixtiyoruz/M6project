%% 1. Applying image transformations

% ToDo: create the function  "apply_H" that gets as input a homography and
% an image and returns the image transformed by the homography.
% At some point you will need to interpolate the image values at some points,
% you may use the Matlab function "interp2" for that.
% function img = apply_H(I,H)
%     %Get the position of the corners to see the padding needed
%     s=size(I);
%     
%     top_left=H*[0 0 1]';
%     top_right=H*[0 s2 1];
%     bottom_left=H*[s1 0 1];
%     bottom_right=H*[s1 s2 1];
%     
%     %Create a padded image (img)
%     %Apply the transformation pixel-by-pixel
%     
%     for mm=1:s(1)
%         for nn=1:s(2)
%             new_p=H*[mm nn 1]'; %With homogeneous coordinates
